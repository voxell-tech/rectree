**Rectree** proposes a simple concept towards user interfaces, that
everything can be represented as a tree of axis-aligned bounding

hence the name "rect-tree".

This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.
