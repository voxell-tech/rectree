**Rectree** proposes a simple concept towards user interfaces, that
everything can be represented as a tree of axis-aligned bounding
boxes (AABB). In **Rectree**, these are represented as rectangles,
hence the name "rect-tree".

Rectree is designed to be:
- **Deterministic**: identical inputs always produce identical
  layouts.
- **Incremental**: only affected subtrees are recomputed.
- **Policy-free**: layout behavior is defined by user-provided
  algorithms.

## Core Concepts

- `Rectree`: a hierarchical tree of rectangular nodes.
- `Constraint`: size limitations flowing *from parent to child*.
- `Size`: resolved dimensions flowing *from child to parent*.
- `LayoutSolver`: user-defined logic that computes constraints,
  sizes, and relative translations.

Rectree itself does not impose a specific layout style (e.g. flexbox,
grid). Instead, it provides a strict data-flow model on top of which
layout algorithms can be built.

### Layout Rules

1. The only data that can flow down the tree is `Constraint`.
2. The only data that can flow up the tree is `Size`.
3. Each child, no matter the order, will recieve the same `Constraint`
   from the parent.
4. Given the same `Constraint`, an unmodified node must always
   produce the same `Size`.

This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.
